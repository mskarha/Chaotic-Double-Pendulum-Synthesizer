# Chaotic Double Pendulum Synthesizer

Note: This is a proof-of-concept

The Chaotic Double Pendulum Synthesizer is an attempt to find musicality in the laws of physics that govern our world. 

The basic idea of a chaotic double pendulum is that it is a simply physical system that exhibits rich dynamic behavior (much more interesting motion that one would expect) with a strong sensitivity to initial conditions. The motion is often described by physicists as unexpectedly mesmerizing. The goal of this project is to capture that mesmerizing motion with electroacoustic music using Max/MSP motion tracking and sound processing. By feeding data about the position, velocity, and acceleration of the pendulums into a series of oscillators, we can “listen” to the chaos that governs some of the laws of physics of our universe.

Future work on this project will involve using a webcam with a higher frame rate to improve performance and tinkering more with output signals.
